# Analyze-Gene-Set-Enrichment-Analysis-Results
Intended to summarize the results of  complex ssGSEA files


 After filtering by a desired FDR p-value, the program clusters the resulting normalized ssGSEA enrichment scores (NES)into a heatmap for visualization
 
results (chr)= the Results.gct output from ssGSEA analysis containing NESs (converted to csv file)

fdr (chr) = the fdr-pvalues.gct output from ssGSEA analysis containing NESs (converted to csv file)

cutoff (num) = the desired fdr p-value cut off to be applied
